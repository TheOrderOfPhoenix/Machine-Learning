## üìù Notes & Discussion

### üî∞ Intro & Philosophy

- The ML group is about **learning together**, not because we *have to*, but because **it makes it better**.
- Key benefits:
  - More consistent learning
  - Social and intellectual motivation
  - Opportunity for future collaborations

---

### üí≠ Reflection on .NET
- .NET started strong but had challenges:
  - Initial teacher-led format added pressure
  - Group expectations sometimes created imbalance
  - Voluntary group ‚â† forced workload
- Positive outcomes:
  - Successfully finished most topics
  - Learned about coordination and project dynamics

---

### üìö How to Handle ML
**Formats considered:**
- Watching a course together  
- Reading a book collectively  
- Taking turns explaining topics  
- Doing small projects  
- Weekly sync-up meetings

**Agreed on:**
- Less pressure, more sharing
- Some members can curate content
- Use GitHub repo with rules + branches
- Encourage multiple contributors, not single leaders

---
### ‚öôÔ∏è Roles and Team
- People may contribute based on time and interest
- Need 2‚Äì3 active curators or maintainers
- Consider forming a **lightweight team** for structure

---
### üìñ Courses and Books
- Decision pending on:
  - Primary source (book vs course)
  - Structure of progression

---
### üõ† Obsidian + GitHub Setup
- Showed vault with:
  - Topics
  - Roadmap
  - Meeting structure
  - Templates
- Emphasis on clean structure and contribution model

---
## ‚úÖ Decisions
- Start with Roadmap + weekly sync
- Contribute resources collaboratively
- GitHub will be used for shared content
- Obsidian as knowledge base
- Keep the group lean and agile (for now)
