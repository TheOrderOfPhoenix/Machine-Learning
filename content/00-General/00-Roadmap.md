This roadmap outlines our shared journey through Machine Learning. It is designed to be hands-on, collaborative, and flexible — grounded in strong resources like *Hands-On ML*, curated online courses, and practical exercises. Each topic links to its own folder containing resources, code, notes, and tasks. We’re building this not just to learn individually, but to grow as a team, help each other, and possibly build something great together.
