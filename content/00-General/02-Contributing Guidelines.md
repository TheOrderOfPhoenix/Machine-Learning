## ðŸ’¾ General Workflow
- Pull before editing
- Push after committing
- One person = one personal notes file (e.g., `Notes-JohnDoe.md`)
- Shared files like `Overview.md` â†’ edit only if youâ€™ve pulled recently and no one else is working on it
- Do NOT change the folder structure without notice

## ðŸ§  Ownership
| File Type     | Who Can Edit                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Notes-Name.md | The owner only                             |
| Overview.md   | Agreed upon                                |
| Other Files   | Anyone (coordinate via Telegram or Issues) |

## ðŸ›  Tools
- Use Obsidian Git plugin or GitHub Desktop
- Keep commit messages clear: "Add summary for CNNs", not "Update"

## ðŸ’¥ Conflicts
- If conflict occurs, ping someone experienced or back up your changes
